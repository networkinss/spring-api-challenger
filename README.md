# OpenAPI generated server

Spring Boot Petstore sample for not so common API endpoints.

## Overview
This is an API stub to provide more uncommon but 100% standard APIs that are not found in the common Petstore API.  
It can be used to test tools if they can cope with other mediatypes than application/json and   
also stuff like special characters (german Umlaute) or correctly processes float numbers.

Contributions to more APIs that cannot be found in the common petstore samples are welcome.
